[Overview]

M150
Rapid point-and-shoot MEMS characterization

The M150 is a MEMS Analyzer used for characterizing microstructural mechanical properties.
Using a simple point-and-shoot laser optical system, the user can quickly obtain resonant peaks of a microstructure through wide bandwidth frequency scanning and real-time Fourier transform (FFT).
